Typescript is a javascript superset developed by Microsoft. Typescript is also used in an Open Source Project that inspired Ryan Dahl called Deno, a Runtime Engine that can be used to execute Typescript.

If you look at the picture above, you will understand, every Javascript Code is a typescript and typescript provides new advantages for javascript so it is often called Extended Javascript.

*What if we could strengthen JavaScript with the things that are missing for large scale application development, like static typing, classes [and] modules... that’s what TypeScript is about.*

*—Anders Hejlsberg*

A program written using typescript must first be compiled into javascript so that it can be executed by a browser or javascript engine.

As a javascript superset we can convert any javascript file into a typescript file by changing its extension:

Typescript is also a superset of EcmaScript which determines the standard specification for writing javascript. ES Next represents future and final versions of EcmaScript.

As a javascript superset what advantages can typescript provide?
